# A Quiet Space: A Self-Help Resource

A place for users to create, review, update and delete written blog-style posts. Users will be able to publish works privately for self review or publically to share. Posts will be searchable by keywords. It is intended to emulate a library space, great for brain storming, idea inspiration, issue venting and general stress relief. This is a resource that I felt I needed throughout my educational career but could not find, so I would like to bring it life!

## Planning Story

The project requirements were used to inspire the flow of the application. Since the effective use of CRUD was to be implemented and the timeline for the project was four days, I decided to create a simple blog-style application that would not require any outsourced data. I began planning by penning the functionality of the app then creating user stories which referenced this as well as the project's requirements. The user stories were used to detail the wireframe and entity relationship diagram and a mock completion schedule was drafted highlighting which tasks would be completed each day. The plan was to begin with the front-end skeleton and continue on to user authentication; afterwhich I would focus on API functionality for user posts and finally front-end styling.

### User Stories

1. As a user I want to know what the application is all about when I navigate to the URL so that I may decide if I want to utilize it.
2. As a user I want to sign-up for an account or sign-in to my pre-existing account so that I may use the application.
3. As a user I want to know that I have signed in successfully so that I may begin using the application.
4. As a user I want to change my password so that I may protect my account's privacy.
5. As a user I want to create, review, update and delete my posts so that I may control the flow of data on my account.
6. As a user I want to search for and review posts made by other users so that I may gain inspiration.
7. As a user I want to sign-out successfully so that I may protect my account's privacy.

### Technologies Used

- Express API
- MongoDB

### Unsolved Problems

In future iterations I would like to allow users to be able to CRUD comments for existing blog posts so that the application has more of a community feel to it as well as improve upon the styling and flow of the application's front end.
